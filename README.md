# Papers

go to `https://aryagadage.github.io/literature.html`

I try to be pretty consistent with keeping up with taking notes of interesting papers, book chapters and classes I have taken/ audited. I try to handwrite and then convert it into a latex doc (so apologies if there are any errors!)

The papers/videos/class info are linked and my notes are in `my notes` (surprise, surprise 😶)
